5. sum of multiples
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

for example:

1, 2, [3], 4, [5], [6], 7, 8, [9]

3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23
Write a program that, given a number, can find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 up to and including that number.

Write the program in javascript with nodejs.

$ node sumOfMultiples.js 10
$ 23
$ node sumOfMultiples.js 5
$ 8
